GamePlan
===================
Imagine you feel like playing some basketball, but you just didn't have the commitment required to sign up for an intramural sport. You can try to round up enough friends for a game and hope that everyones' schedules match up, but rarely does that approach work out. GamePlan is a simple application that makes it easy to coordinate spontaneous pick-up games with strangers and friends in order to have enough people to actually play.
