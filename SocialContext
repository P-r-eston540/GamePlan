People play sports for a variety of reasons: fun, stress relief, boredom, the social aspect, etc. Many people wish they
had the opportunity to play sports more often, but they do not have the proper resources. GamePlan helps make those
resources available.

For example, it is difficult for one person to find enough people that they know directly whose schedules are all open at
the same time so they can all play a game together. Schedules may not match up, friends within a group may want to play
different sports, or there may simply just not be enough people. These are all common problems that prevent people from
playing pickup games. GamePlan allows a user to post an event by specifying the activity, time, place, and any other
special notes about the event.

GamePlan is a social network for playing sports. This application will encourage more people to be physically active as it
will allow for the simplified coordination of pickup games between people with a common interest in playing specific
sports. It will also allow users to meet interesting new people who they may have otherwise never met.

Upon opening the app, users will see options to either host a new event, search specifically for an upcoming event by
“sport”, or just see any event that is to start soon. 

If one person knows only two other people to play Ultimate Frisbee with and creates a GamePlan event, others will see it.
If five other people see the event and each have two friends who are interested in playing with them also, boom. You have
18 people ready to go for the game later! GamePlan is all about making the connections with other people so more people
can have fun.
